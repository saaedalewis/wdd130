        <p> I was born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, surrounded by rich culture, vibrant music,
            and strong
            family values. I was raised by my mother, a devoted single parent who worked tirelessly
            to provide
            for my siblings and me. Watching her balance long workdays while still caring for us
            taught me
            resilience, gratitude, and the value of hard work. Although I did not grow up knowing my
            father, my
            mother’s sacrifices shaped my character and determination. Currently, I am pursuing a
            degree in Web Development while staying home with my children. Although
            my academic journey has been slower, it has strengthened my discipline and
            time-management skills.
            My goal is to complete my degree, build a stable career in technology, and create a
            loving,
            supportive home where my children can thrive. </p>
